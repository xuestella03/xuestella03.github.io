## About Me
Hi there! My name is Estella. I’m a senior at Northwestern University working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science. My experience ranges from financial modeling to data science, machine learning, and working in the cloud with AWS and APIs. I’ve also done research in abstract math, and outside of class, I enjoy diving deeper into math topics in the Directed Reading Program in the Department of Mathematics. I’m a lover of group theory and all things abstract algebra!

I’m currently looking for roles in quantitative research, trading, data science, and software engineering where I can apply my analytical skills and passion for problem-solving. 

I started my journey as a musician (I entered college to study Bassoon Performance and Economics), and though I have pivoted to quite a different area, music taught me how to learn, improve, and better structure my practice – skills I carry with me in everything I do now. I credit a lot of my achievements to my music teachers, who taught me the patience, discipline, and attention to detail necessary to master challenging tasks. 

I’m also a teaching assistant in the Department of Mathematics. I’ve always loved teaching, having done a lot of tutoring during high school (fun fact: I once taught English in Spanish to ESL students, though unfortunately, I am no longer proficient in speaking Spanish). I find it extremely rewarding to explain concepts and help others grow their understanding.

When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy working out and cooking. I’ve recently gotten into playing video games – I’ve found it very fulfilling to play intentionally and focus on improving.

I’m always up for learning something new, whether it’s in tech, math, or life in general!
