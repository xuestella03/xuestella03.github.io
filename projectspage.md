## Research Experience and Talks
[**Coadjoint Orbits of Extensions of Lie Groups**](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cfthgkqvbyfx#bd801e)
- Wrote a grant proposal and was awarded the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant.
- Conducted an 8-week independent research project to rigorously prove new properties of coadjoint orbits of extensions of Lie groups under the guidance of Professor Santiago Ca√±ez.
- Authored a final paper on the subject.
