## Projects

**Advertisement Conversion Modeling** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, XGBoost, GridSearchCV, pandas, scikit-learn*
- Implemented functions to clean conversion and non-conversion datasets using Pandas dataframes. Performed data analysis by writing functions to compare continuous and categorical variables (e.g., conversion by zip code).
- Built one classification model using XGBoost and another using GridSearchCV to predict the conversions and non-conversions of advertisements given features such as zip code, browser, etc.
- Trained and tested the classifier by splitting conversion/non-conversion datasets. Achieved ROC AUC score of 0.88.

**Fridge and Grocery Application in Amazon Web Services** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03">GitHub Repository</a>

*AWS (S3, RDS, Lambda), RESTful APIs, Python, JavaScript*
- Built an application allowing users to keep track of items in their fridge and create grocery lists based on ingredients needed for uploaded PDF recipes. Extracted text from images or non-PDF recipe formats. 
- Used S3 to store PDFs and RDS to track users following practices for RESTful APIs. Added user authentication. 
- Wrote client-side Python code and AWS Lambda functions to create a “serverless” and event-driven architecture.
- Created a similar project with a web server tier in JavaScript using Node.js and Express frameworks. Applied asynchronous execution programming style. 

**Python Network Scanning Tool** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03/DomainScanner">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, Security Protocols (DNS, TLS, HTTP, HSTS), nmap, OpenSSL, nslookup*
- Developed a command-line tool to analyze web domains and evaluate network characteristics and security features. 
- Automated the retrieval of network data such as IP addresses, HTTP server details, TLS versions, and root certificate authorities using utilities such as OpenSSL and nslookup.
- Implemented a JSON reporting framework to present results.
- Ensured portability by managing third-party dependencies and creating a distribution-ready package.

**Predictive Modeling of Stock Market Movement** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, Random Forest Classifiers, yfinance, scikit-learn*
- Used Random Forest classifiers to predict daily movements of a given stock or index using the opening and closing price, the volume traded, and the highest and lowest price.
- Used the mean reversion theory by adding additional predictors including the ratio between today's closing price and the rolling average over varying periods of time. 
- Backtested the model using growing amounts of data to predict subsequent periods. 
- Analyzed market sentiment from news data and included it as a predictor.

**Derivative Pricing and Financial Modeling** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, Financial Theory, Stochastic Volatility, numpy, matplotlib*
- Developed an options pricing model using Black-Scholes to calculate the prices of European options. 
- Calculated the Greeks to assess the sensitivity of option prices to market factors.
- Improved the model to account for volatility fluctuations using Heston's Model. 
- Implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to predict portolio values over time. Analyzed historical data and applied Cholesky decomposition to simulate correlated returns. 
- Interpreted simulation results by computing measures such as value at risk, variance, and confidence intervals. 


**Jointed Assemblies with Shading and Lighting** - <a href="https://github.com/xuestella03/ComputerGraphicsProject">GitHub Repository</a>
