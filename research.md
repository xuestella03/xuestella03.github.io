## Research Experience

**Distributed Databases on Heterogeneous Clusters** 

<a href="https://github.com/xuestella03/RPi-Cluster-Spark">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, Ansible, Scala, Bash Scripting, Spark*

- Designed and implemented hardware-conscious scheduling and query execution for a distributed database on a heterogeneous cluster (12 Raspberry Pis, 2 Rock Pros, 1 server), improving runtime, cost, and power usage. 
- Extended Spark's scheduler for heterogeneous environments, dynamically accounting for node-specific memory and compute capabilities. 
- Deployed and optimized the cluster using PXE boot to test OS and JVM configurations, and automated TPC-H benchmarking and management with Ansible for scalable performance evaluation. 

**Join Implementations on Distributed Databases** 

<a href="https://github.com/xuestella03/Quest-MPI-Dist-DB">GitHub Repository</a>

*Python, MPI, HPC Clusters, Docker, Socket, Bash*
- Simulated a distributed database system and developed coordination logic for executing join algorithms across nodes. Analyzed implementations and compared performance metrics.
- Integrated DuckDB and Parquet file transfer to reduce serialization overhead and improve I/O efficiency.
- Used Message Passing Interface (MPI) to implement distributed joins on Northwestern's HPC cluster (Quest) and evaluated scalability on 1, 2, 3, 8, and 16 nodes.
- Optimized performance with Python's Multiprocessing and MPI's non-blocking operations.
- Deployed a distributed network using Docker containers and Python's Socket to simulate multi-node environments.
- Evaluated execution time of each join phase using TPC-H benchmarks on both Quest and Docker environments.
- Reviewed 4+ papers on distributed join algorithms; authored a final report and delivered both a lecture and final presentation on design trade-offs and results.

**Coadjoint Orbits of Extensions of Lie Groups**

<a href="assets/img/SURG Summary Report.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of summary report.</a>

<a href="assets/img/SURG Shortened Final.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of final paper.</a>
- Wrote a grant proposal and was awarded the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant.
- Conducted an 8-week independent research project to rigorously prove new properties of coadjoint orbits of extensions of Lie groups under the guidance of Professor Santiago Cañez.
- Authored a final paper on the subject.

**Optimal Transport Using Network Flows** 

<a href="assets/img/Optimal Transport Using Network Flows.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of paper.</a>
- Authored a final paper with another student (Leo Chang) discussing optimal transport using network flows. 
- Addressed the following problem: given a network of supply and demand nodes where each path starts in supply and ends in demand, find the minimum amount of work required to transport resources from supply to demand given the weights of each path.
- Presented the algorithm to solve the problem and explicated an example problem. 

## Talks

**Directed Reading Program Fall 2023 & Spring 2024**

The Directed Reading Program in the Northwestern University Department of Mathematics pairs each undergraduate student with a graduate mentor; the student then picks a topic to study with guidance from their mentor. At the end of each quarter, the student presents their topic to an audience of professors and students. Through this experience, I greatly improved my ability to learn, problem solve, and communicate my ideas.

*Affine Algebraic Varieties* - *May 2, 2024*

<a href="assets/img/DRP Spring 2024 - Affine Algebraic Varieties.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of annotated presentation slideshow.</a>
- Discussed the equivalences between geometry an algebra.
- Presented applications and implications of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.

*Smooth Manifolds and Lie Groups* - *December 1, 2023*

<a href="assets/img/DRP Fall 2023 - Smooth Manifolds and Lie Groups.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of annotated presentation slideshow.</a>
- Presented an accessible definition of manifolds and Lie groups.
- Provided examples of manifolds and Lie groups; analyzed and proved a non-example by leveraging properties of the tangent bundle of a manifold.
