- Wrote a grant proposal and was awarded the Summer Undergraduate Research Grant.
- Conducted an 8-week independent research project to rigorously prove new properties of coadjoint orbits of extensions of Lie groups under the guidance of Professor Santiago Ca√±ez.
- Authored a final paper on the subject.

## Talks

**Directed Reading Program Fall 2023 & Spring 2024**

The Directed Reading Program in the Northwestern University Department of Mathematics pairs each undergraduate student with a graduate mentor; the student then picks a topic to study with guidance from their mentor. At the end of each quarter, the student presents their topic to an audience of professors and students. Through this experience, I greatly improved my ability to learn, problem solve, and communicate my ideas.
